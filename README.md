# Arduino-Uno-Calendar-Final-Project
A final project in a hardware course using the Arduino Uno and programming in C to make a physical interface for a calendar - using google calendar as reference.


This project was in cooperation with the charity foundation of "Hinuh L'Psagot" which is an Israeli organization that helps children from ages 8-18 which have potential for greatness achieve their goals.
This project was created during the corona virus outbreak and as such is targeted to help the children conduct their zoom sessions with ease.
The main purpose was to create a physical interface which is easily used and placed upon the desktop that will help the children control their calendars and get the zoom links as reliably as possible.
Functionality: the device has 4 buttons,SlideSwitch,LED strip and 2 potentiometers which are used as such - there is a button inorder to press TAB, a button for ENTER a slideswitch for ON stage and a standalone stage( which has our ledstrips shining colors changing to keep the desktop visually pleasing), the last button is for the timer which lets the student know how long the lesson will last - the student can use the timer potentiometer to set a timer and then press the timer button - when said button is pressed the timer will be shown via the LED strips (red when the lesson isn't close to being finished - yellow when it has 30 minutes left and green when there are 15 minutes or below).
the second potentiometer is used to brief through the weeks on the calendar.

added code and pictures are in repository.
